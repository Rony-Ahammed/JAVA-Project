It covers roughly 1,250 ha of&#10; semi-perennial tropical forests. By the Bangladesh government in 1996, under the Wildlife Act&#10; of 1974, the land was declared a national park.This Park is very widespread for worldwide&#10; threatened four species: Northern Pig-tailed Macaque, Phayreâ€™s Leaf Monkey, Capped Langur,&#10; and the most important population in Bangladesh of Western Hoolock Gibbon, the only ape&#10; found in Bangladesh. Lawachara is perhaps the only forest in the world to see this globally &#10;endangered species the western hoolock gibbon, but only about 16 families are left here.&#10;The beauty of tall forest trees, cool clean air, and misty green seem a sphere away from the rest&#10; of Bangladesh. This is a popular destination for nature lovers and the scientists and surveys &#10;continually find species new for the forest and several species are only known in Bangladesh&#10; from Lawachara.This forest is magnificent for its biodiversity and hosts 15 species of &#10;amphibians, 52 species of reptiles, 258 species of birds and about 20 species of mammals and&#10; an Important population of globally endangered Western Hoolock Gibbon. There are also &#10;diverse ethnic communities called Kasiaz, tipra, monipuri.     ">
